                            <p>MANILA, Philippines Reliable information based on satellite data and ground
                                observations
                                can help the Philippines prepare for and mitigate the effect of recurring disasters,
                                such as typhoons and El Nino, on rice areas in Mindanao.<br /><br />
                                The Philippine Rice Information System (PRISM) has been providing the Department of
                                Agriculture (DA) with timely seasonal data on rice area and yield and assessment of
                                crop
                                health and damage in the event of a typhoon, flood, or drought since 2014. PRISM
                                will
                                present its achievements and activities to a wider audience in its first annual
                                executive meeting on 31 March.<br /><br />
                                “PRISM uses remote sensing, crop modelling, cloud computing, and smart phone-based
                                surveys for rice mapping and monitoring,” said Alice Laborte, who leads the PRISM
                                project at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). PRISM, one of seven
                                projects under the Food Staples Sufficiency Program (FSSP), is a collaborative
                                project
                                among IRRI, Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice), and the DA. The
                                development
                                and implementation of PRISM in the Philippines are funded under the DA's National
                                Rice
                                Program.<br /><br />
                                PRISM uses high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery acquired
                                throughout
                                the rice growing season. SAR imagery can be acquired day or night and even on cloudy
                                days. This makes the technology perfect for monitoring rice growth and assessing
                                damage
                                to rice crops resulting from floods and typhoons.<br /><br />
                                Through field surveys the rice maps derived from satellite images are being
                                validated
                                where they enjoin and train local field technicians from the DA’s regional field
                                offices, local government units, and, in some cases, farmers to gather the data. In
                                improving damage and loss assessments to assist in providing appropriate
                                interventions
                                for rehabilitation and recovery and to improve pre-disaster preparedness, these
                                pieces
                                of information are very useful.<br /><br /></p><b>Source:</b>http://irri.org/
